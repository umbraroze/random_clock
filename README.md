This is a quick, random analog clock that I wrote in
[Processing](https://processing.org/), because:

1. I was depressed and 
2. I hadn't written an analog clock before. To heck with it, it had to
   be done.

This is basically the old prototype thing written in July 17-18, 2024.
I'm writing a new clock - that is also a little bit more useful - in
Godot Engine, and it's available in Codeberg here:
[GodotClock](https://codeberg.org/umbraroze/GodotClock)

This (and the new clock) is available under the MIT licence but I
don't really care if you take a looksie and learn from this if you're
writing your own clock or something.

This also includes a p5.js version.
See it in action in [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2855584)!
